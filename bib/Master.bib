abstract = {Semantic Web Constraint Language (SWCL) was proposed in 2006 with the vision of enhancing the quality of humansâ€™ decision-making by machines in Semantic Web environments, complementing the missing but important part which acknowledges constraints on concepts represented by ontology. Even though, the XML syntax for SWCL itself is too verbose and has a downside that needs to be generated by hand with deep knowledge of OWL. In this respect, users have to be aware of the syntax and semantics of OWL in deep in order to generate a problem description in SWCL by hand without any error. Moreover, due to the complexity of SWCL, it would be tedious work to generate all constraints with SWCL in many cases. These reasons causes decrease of the efficiency and popularity for SWCL. In order to cope with these issues, we developed ontology-based optimization modelling tool using SWCL which can help users to manipulate the problem model in SWCL straightforward and make the optimization model intuitive as well. Through our research and development, we supplement the method to represent the class description for each variable in SWCL with Manchester syntax which is developed in response to a demand from a wide range of users, who do not have the background knowledge for Description Logic (DL). We developed and implemented the variable detection algorithm and the related constraints extraction algorithm to construct the optimization model selecting the constraints in SWCL that are distributed and shared in the Semantic Web environments. In addition, the translation algorithm and tool that could be able to vii convert the problem model in SWCL to problem description in OPL modelling language. The developed tool was applied to a production scheduling problem for virtual enterprise to validate the usability of our methodology. This research shows that various problems with different objective and constraints could be manipulated to construct the optimization model by the ontology-based optimization modelling tool.},
