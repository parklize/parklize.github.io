<p>With the popularity of microblogging services such as Twitter in recent years, an increasing number of users use these services in their daily lives. The huge volume of information generated by users raises new opportunities in various applications and areas. Inferring user interests plays a signicant role in providing personalized recommendations on microblogging services, and third-party applications providing social logins via these services, especially in cold-start situations.</p>
<p>In this survey, we review user modeling strategies with respect to inferring user interests in previous studies. To this end, we focus on four dimensions of inferring user interest profiles: (1) data collection, (2) representation of user interest profiles, (3) construction and enhancement of user interest profiles, and (4) the evaluation of the constructed profiles. Through this survey, we aim to provide an overview of state-of-the-art user modeling strategies for inferring user interest profiles on microblogging social networks with respect to the four dimensions. For each dimension, we review and summarize previous studies based on specified criteria. Finally, we discuss some challenges and opportunities for future work in this research domain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition (User Model)</strong>. A <strong>user model</strong> is a (data) structure that is used to capture certain characteristics about an individual user, and a <strong>user profile</strong> is the actual representation in a given user model. The process of obtaining the user profile is called <strong>user modeling</strong>.</p>
